# Medical-Image-Analysis-for-Early-Disease-Detection-using-Yolov5 
The primary mission of our project is to harness the power of Computer Vision
Vision, in particular using the YOLOv5 model, for the early detection of tumors
in medical images. In this context, Computer Vision plays a pivotal role, employing
pivotal role, employing object detection techniques to accurately locate and identify
areas associated with tumors. YOLOv5, recognized for its efficiency
in real-time object detection, is being deployed with determination to overcome the
obstacles to early tumor detection.

# Dataset 
This data set, which comes from the Roboflow platform, consists of three
folders: "train" (training), "valid" (validation) and "test", each containing
subfolders "images" and "labels". The
"folder contains the actual image data, while the "labels" folder contains annotations
annotations, in particular information on bounding boxes. In addition, a
file in YAML format is provided, simplifying the training process by offering
direct compatibility.
